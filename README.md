# ModWorkshop Manager

This repo contains a very early version of the mod manager. It barely does anything and you shouldn't be using it yet.

The mod manager is built on .NET 8 with the Avalonia framework.

To test the mod manager, turn on Developer Mode here: https://modworkshop.net/user-settings/settings. You should see the button appear in the supported games' mods.
