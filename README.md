# ModWorkshop Manager

This repo contains an early version of the mod manager. It may not work fully and some features are not yet implemented.

You can download the mod manager in the releases tab.
To test the mod manager, turn on Developer Mode here: https://modworkshop.net/user-settings/settings. You should see the button appear in the supported games' mods.
To be able to use it, ensure that you've launched it at least once for the links to work. This will be done automatically later when the mod manager will have an installer.

A list of features, supported games and a documentation site will be made soon.
The mod manager is built on .NET 8 with the Avalonia framework.
